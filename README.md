## cpr search app poc

We've used django to speed up the REST part of the API as some will include crud operations as part of it.
We've used a SQLite db to implement the POC.

## other things to explore with more time
lemmatize (botswana's)
Use FastAPI
store documents as vectors
use a database which supports vector search e.g.
redis (new)
elasticsearch (also ann)
retrain a bert model or train a new model
pagination on list and search results
add some more tests
improve reg exps for especially for numbers with punctuations.
n-grams/sentences/docs as a whole?
move to docker compose file to pull into db containers for local experiments
run code formatter
include title, sectors

## installation instructions

on *nix: make a virtual environment, install pip requirements and 

```sh
run.sh
```

OR

docker, if you prefer docker or you are running on windows and spacy doesn't install.

In the directory with the Dockerfile:
```sh
docker build -t cpr . && docker run -p 8000:8000 cpr

# or with live reload (%cd% on windows instead of $PWD)
docker build -t cpr . && docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD/cpr:/usr/src/app cpr
docker build -t cpr . && docker run -p 8000:8000 -v %cd%/cpr:/usr/src/app cpr
```
